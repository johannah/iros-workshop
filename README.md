## Informed Scientific Sampling in Large-scale Outdoor Environments

In this workshop, we aim at understanding the progress in the field of robotic sampling for monitoring large-scale outdoor environments, such as forests, large water bodies, agricultural fields, and complex urban settings. We also plan to focus and learn about the challenges faced by researchers in mapping and understanding these difficult environments. This workshop is aimed at providing a complete overview of the research related to field robotics in aerial, forest, urban, and marine applications. 

We plan to discuss a series of research issues that include measurement collection and evaluation, communication between multiple data-sampling robots, data fusion, sensor motion, pollution monitoring, and wildlife tracking. Regardless of the applications, all these tasks aim at information acquisition.

One of the major applications of mobile robotics is exploring and mapping an unknown environmental field. Persistent spatio-temporal maps of environmental phenomena have a critical role in understanding the interplay between the changing global conditions and human activities that might be causing these changes. Building such persistent maps of environmental fields for a given region over a period of time requires continuous sensing. This problem has been tackled previously by deploying a network of static sensor nodes uniformly across the region of interest or by conducting a uniform survey of the region. In general, however, environmental fields of interest are non-uniform over a given region and dynamic over a time period. Persistent mapping of such fields requires the mobile robots which selectively sense and are aimed at reducing cost and increasing flexibility when compared to static sensors.

# Intended Audience

Robotic environmental sampling and marine robotics are growing areas and include a range of issues that are distinctive with respect to the broader robotics community. Number of researchers interested in field robotics, particularly in marine environments, has increased in recent years. As environment monitoring is gaining more importance, there is a need for robotic solutions to these problems. This calls for an emphasis on large-scale multi-robot deployments and increased robustness. The expected audience to our workshop include experts in the field of robotic environmental sensing, researchers interested in taking their robotic solutions out into the field and wanting to understand the challenges involved, young researchers who want to present their work and get some qualitative feedback from experts, and researchers who are generally interested in understanding the advances and challenges in field robotics. We are also interested in attracting participation from biologists and environmental scientists from outside the traditional robotics discipline.
